The idea of MDS is to reconstruct $\\bar{X}$ (or an equivalent coordinate system) via the eigenvectors of $B$.  A key point is that if the data clusters close to a subspace with fewer than $d$ dimensions, we can recover a coordinate system for that lower-dimensional subspace."

Instead, we can decompose $\\bar{X} = U \\Sigma V^T$, and use the mapping $x \\mapsto U_k^T x$ to get the lower-dimensional embedding $Y = \\Sigma_k V_k^T$ that optimally preserve distances.  That is, classical MDS and PCA are equivalent to each other; but classical MDS is typically used when we only have distances."
