## Warm-up

- Name, area, and a favorite textbook (take notes!)
  - If you are elsewhere, we'll find someone for you to do this with!

## Logistics

- Waitlist notes
- Time zone issues
- Julia and other languages
- Readings

## Optimization background

- Variational notation
- Reminder that Lagrange multipliers exist!
- Direct solves, fixed point iterations
- Models of functions and models of solver dynamics

## Least squares

- Normal equations and calculus
- Alternate inner products
- Cholesky, QR, and SVD
- Aside re min norm connection

## Activity (submit a notebook or PDF for points)

- Show that if $\phi : \mathcal{V} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a 
  quadratic form, then $a(v,w) = (\phi(v+w)-\phi(v)-\phi(w))/2$ is a
  bilinear form for which $\phi(v) = a(v,v)$.
- Show that adding rows to a matrix (e.g. more data in a least squares
  problem) can only increase the smallest singular value.
- Write a code to minimize
  $$\sum_{j=0}^N |p(x_j)-\cos(x_j)|^2$$
  where $x_j$ are points in a uniform mesh on $[-\pi, \pi]$,
  with $p(x) = c_0 + c_1 x^2 + c_2 x^4 + c_3 x^6$.
- Argue that the coefficients converge to the coefficients that minimize
  $\int_{-\pi}^\pi |p(x)-\cos(x)|^2 \, dx$?
- Design (and answer) your own question that would be appropriate for
  this type of exercise!
