## Notes from feedback

- We can dispense with the warm-up (few liked it)
- Randomly shuffled groups are tricky
  - Will try nailing down groups
  - Survey: who do you want to work with?
- Rearranging group work breakout
  - Will try to post *one* (longer) notebook by start of week
  - Exercises associated with Tuesday + previous Thursday
  - Budget half an hour group at end of Thursday lecture
  - May end Tuesday lectures walking through notebook setup

Reminders:

- You will get more out of class if you read ahead!
- Ask questions early!

## Constraints and multipliers

This will be terse, but I have some longer notes
([notebook](nb-2021-03-11.ipynb), [pdf](nb-2021-03-11.pdf)).

- KKT conditions and constrained optimization
- Physical interpretation of Lagrange multipliers
- Barriers, penalties, and projected gradients

## NMF

- Basics
  - Definition, non-negative rank
  - Parts decomposition and sparsity
  - Applications
- Separable NMF and interpolative decomposition
  - Basic assumption
  - Pure pixels, anchor words, etc
  - Role of pivoted QR
- Frobenius norm NMF (vs other loss functions)
- Gradient-based algorithms
  - Projected gradient descent
  - Lee-Seung update
- (Block) coordinate descent methods
  - Simple coordinate descent
  - Block descent and HALS-RRI
  - ANLS and the non-negative LS building block
