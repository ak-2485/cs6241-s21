## Warm-up

Discuss and register your thoughts on:

1. What about the class is working well for you?
2. What should we consider doing differently?

I am particularly interested in thoughts on how we are using the
meeting time.  Is the intro / lecture / breakout structure useful?
Are there things we should do to make the group interactions better?
