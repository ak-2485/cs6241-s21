## Warm-up

Consider the equations
$\alpha x^2 + \beta x = \gamma$
and the fixed point iteration
$\beta x_{k+1} = \gamma - \alpha x_k^2$.

Write an error iteration.  Can you give conditions on the coefficients
and the initial error that are sufficient to guarantee convergence?

## Logistics

- Reaction paper - March 15
  - May do in small groups if you want (up to 3)
  - Problem spec and some paper pointers online
  - [SIAM CSE](https://meetings.siam.org/program.cfm?CONFCODE=CSE21)
    has lots of relevant talks (and often you can chase down pointers)
- Project proposal - March 22
  - Again in small groups (1-3)
  - Not required to be the same direction as reaction paper
  - Use the discussion board to advertise!

## Rand NLA comments

- Sketching vs preconditioning

## Matrix data

- Matrix data and (approximate) low-rank structure
  - Example data: images, docs, graphs, preferences, joint distributions
  - Interpretation: latent factors and bilinear maps
- Supervised learning applications
  - Imputation and missing data (e.g. collaborative filtering)
  - Guided dimension reduction (e.g. linear discriminant analysis)
- Unsupervised learning applications
  - k-means clustering as a matrix factorization (and alternating iteration)
  - Latent-space embeddings (e.g. LSI)
  - Latent Dirichlet Allocation, NMF, and interepretable topic models
- Example: Linear Discriminant Analysis
  - Basic setup
  - Key numerical issues (robustness and performance)
