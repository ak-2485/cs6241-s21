## Course description

This is a graduate level course on numerical methods prominent in
modern data analysis and machine learning.  Students must have a
strong grounding in linear algebra and probability as well as
sufficient mathematical maturity.  Prior experience with numerical
methods at the level of CS 4210/4220 or CS 6210/6220 will be highly
useful, though not strictly required.  The course will consist of six
units of about two weeks each:

 - Least squares and regression
 - Low-rank factorizations for matrix and tensor data
 - Low-dimensional structure in function approximation
 - Kernel interpolation and Gaussian processes
 - Numerical methods for graph data analysis
 - Methods for learning models of dynamics
 
We will pay particular attention throughout to sparsity, rank
structure, and spectral behavior of underlying linear algebra
problems; convergence behavior and "regularization via iteration"
effects for standard solvers; and comparisons between numerical
methods for data analysis with large-scale numerical methods used in
other areas of science and engineering.

### Course work

Notes and readings will be posted on the course web page.  We
recommend reading the notes prior to the meeting.

Class meetings will typically consist of an ice-breaker, open
question, or group quiz, followed by lecture and full-class
discussion.  We will try to reserve part of the time for small-group
work involving either paper discussions or working through a
Jupyter notebook.

Other than activities to help students keep on track with the
readings, the main course activity will be a course research project.

### Course technology

The public course web page will be used for all activities that can
readily be shared with the world.  Otherwise, we will use Canvas for
assignments, together with integrations for discussion (Ed Discussion)
and social annotation of the reading (Hypothes.is).  We will use
Jupyter notebooks and the Julia programming language for in-class
exercises; these can be run locally on your machine or via Google Colab.

## Course policies

### Grading

Graded work will be 50% a term research project, 45% participation,
and 5% course feedback and evaluations.  On a 200 point scale, this
will consist of:

#### Research project

After an initial reaction paper (done individually), students will
work in groups of 1-3 on a term-length research project.  Part of the
credit will involve participating in peer review of contributions
from two other groups.  The parts of this project will include:

- Reaction paper involving reading and critique of at least two
  papers - 10 points
- Project proposal for 1-3 people, including pointers to related work
  and a plan for how team members will work together - 10 points
- Short progress report - 5 points
- Draft report - 10 points
- Peer review of two other draft reports - 10 points each
- Final report - 40 points

#### Participation and feedback

After the first lecture where we lay out this syllabus, there will be
25 additional lectures.  We ask for 90 points of "participation work,"
defined as

- Participating in a class opening activity or quiz (1 point)
- Completing a class/homework notebook (1 point per question)
- Written participation in class discussion of a paper (1 point)
- Providing a (solved) question suitable for a homework (1 point)
- Defining an open research question, with reference to literature (1 point)

For homework, quizzes, or questions that are clearly incorrect, we
will provide feedback and a chance to provide a correction (or
convince us that we are wrong!).  Participation work does not have to
be done wholly during class meetings.

### Collaboration

Collaboration in this class is explicitly encouraged, as is reference
to the research literature.  You can and should work together, with
co-authorship for group assignments.

An assignment is an academic document, like a journal article.
When you turn it in, you are claiming everything in it is your
original work, *unless you cite a source for it*.

If you get an idea from a classmate, the TA or professor, a book or
other published source, or elsewhere, please provide an appropriate
citation.  This is not only critical to maintaining academic
integrity, but it is also an important way for you to give credit to
those who have helped you out.  When in doubt, cite!  Code or writeups
with appropriate citations will never be considered a violation of
academic integrity in this class (though you will not receive credit
for code or writeups that were shared when you should have done them
yourself).

For more information, see Cornell's
[Code of Academic Integrity](http://cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html).

### Emergency procedures

In the event of a major campus emergency, course requirements, deadlines, and
grading percentages are subject to changes that may be necessitated by a
revised semester calendar or other circumstances.  Any such announcements will
be posted to Canvas and [the course home page](index.html).
